Welcome!

The `metal-rs` library exposes unsafe Rust bindings for the [Metal 3D graphics API](https://developer.apple.com/metal/), allowing you to write Metal applications entirely in Rust.

The `metal-rs` wiki serves as a higher-level guide on getting started with `metal-rs`.

To skip straight to full code examples you can check out the [examples] directory.
